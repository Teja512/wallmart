				<p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.</p>
				<p>From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu — three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute — suggested defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality".</p>

					Docker has <a
						href="http://www.actonmagic.com/blog/container-vs-virtualization/">revolutionized
						containerization</a> of applications allowing Devops to package any
					application in a lightweight environment. The packaging is done in
					a way which makes it as easy as installing a mobile app.It is
					considered as most popular devops tools
				</p>
				<p>It&nbsp;is a application container platform for build, ship
					and run your distributed apps.Ecosystem includes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight run-time and
						packaging tool for building containerized apps.</li>
					<li>Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing apps and
						automating workflows.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					It allows the&nbsp;developers containerize their apps and can run
					these apps anywhere. It is a powerful ecosystem where devops can
					leverage many apps available on Docker Hub. It&nbsp;is built on the
					top of Linux containers. <a href="http://docker">You can read
						more about Docker here</a>

				<p>Ansible is a configuration management tool or devops tools
					that is similar to Puppet and Chef.</p>
				<p>Ansible is a very simple configuration language, I would say.
					A beginner can write a basic script and deploy a few cloud
					instances in just a day.</p>
				<p>For configuration management, its just too easy to learn and
					write in ANSIBLE as it understands “yaml” format. Developer
					friendly and Devops friendly.</p>
				<p>Ansible always runs in order and exits immediately when an
					error occurs.&nbsp;Also while using Ansible, one has to know about
					the commands that they need to give. For example yum for redhat
					distributions and apt-get for ubuntu etc. In chef or puppet, they
					take care of translating to individual distribution and user need
					not worry about specifying correct commands as per the
					distribution.</p>
				<p>Earlier windows was not supported in Ansible but with windows
					supported now, Ansible solves configuration problem at a small
					scale.</p>
				<p>But when it comes to scaling and complex configurations, of
					course chef and puppet scores. As long as one is having 3 digits in
					the number of servers, ansible looks to be ok and beyond that one
					has to choose Chef or Puppet.</p>
